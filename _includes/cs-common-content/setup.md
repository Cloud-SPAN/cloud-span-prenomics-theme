# Overview

The software and data used for cloud based analysis during the course are hosted on an Amazon Web Services (AWS) Machine Image (AMI) instance. A copy of such instance that requires no previous setup by you will be made available to you at no cost by the Cloud-SPAN team. **Windows users** will need to install Git for Windows on their laptop or desktop machine as described below. Git includes the tool **Git Bash** which will enable Windows user attendees to use a Unix-like shell environment to access their AMI. (Such an environment is available by default for Linux and Mac users.) 

Due to the need to both follow the instructor in zoom and perform analysis, **tablets** and **ipads are not suitable** for using during this course. Having a second screen is not necessary for this course, however if you have access to this, this may make it easier to follow along. We will be using a web version of the integrative genomics viewer (IGV), alongside using zoom and connecting to the AMI, and so having both an up to date browser and a stable internet connection is important.


## Installing Git Bash in your Windows personal computer

Attendees using a Windows laptop or desktop must install **Git Bash** prior to the course, as instructed below. Git Bash is a command-line interface (CLI), also known as a **shell** or **terminal**, which will enable you to access your AMI from your personal computer. Attendees using a Linux or Mac OS X computer **do not need to install** any additional software, but only open a terminal running the Bash shell. 

The steps below correspond to the installation of Git for Windows version 2.33.1 from scratch. The installation of a more recent version, or updating a previously installed version, may show different wording in the screen messages mentioned below or may vary slightly in the number of steps to follow. Just choose as many of the options below as possible. 
- Download the [Git for Windows installer](https://gitforwindows.org/) which installs both Git and Git Bash.
